# French Press
Mobile app that opens new avenues to coffee through a focus on local vendors and the variety of brewing techniques. 

## The MVP
> French Press, by the end of the development process should open to an interactive map whose pins when selected reveal a card displaying info regarding the coffee shop. 
  - For example, the card should display seating availability, outlets, table size, quality of coffee (perhaps gathered from ratings), etc.

## Milestones
- Team should understand the project holistically
- Split teams for Front End and Back End development
- Front End completion of wire frames and tech stack installation
- Back End should be familiarized with Firebase at this point working on account validation
- Ability to search and retrieve local Coffee Shops in the area
- Ability to click on a pin and it display info regarding the Coffee Shop
- Incorporate possible coffee brewing help, e.g a brewing calculator or cards displaying brewing methods.

## Stretch Goals
- Brewing Cards
- Partnering with local coffee shops
- Navigation ability
- brewing calculator

## Tech Stack

##### Here are some ideas:
* [React Native] - component based frame work, prevents boilerplating!
* [Flutter] - Flutter is Googleâ€™s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
* [Firebase] - Integrates easily with both Flutter and React.
* [Android Studio] - You should know why.
* [git] - Pretty terminal. Download git BASH.
